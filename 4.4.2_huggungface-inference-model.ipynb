    "SageMaker Inference Recommender is a new capability of SageMaker that reduces the time required to get machine learning (ML) models in production by automating performance benchmarking and load testing models across SageMaker ML instances. You can use Inference Recommender to deploy your model to a real-time inference endpoint that delivers the best performance at the lowest cost. \n",
